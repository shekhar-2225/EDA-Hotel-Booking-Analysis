Hotel Bookings Analysis project consists with the real - world data record of hotel bookings of a city hotel and a resort hotel for the period 2015 - 2017 respectively. The project data record consists of information such as type of hotel booked, average daily rate, booking details, arrival date, length of the stay, the number of adults, children, and / or babies booked, customer country, meal preferences, type of the customer, parking space details, reservation status, channels used for booking, booking cancellation details, booking lead time details, among other details.

# Project Files:

Executable File: All theexecutions and data analysis is performed in Python using Google's cloud platform Colaboratory, https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YEKAEEp7RCfziizvqm-l_puI5A8z9moP?usp=sharing this file contains data analysis, exploration, visualisations and conclusion. Data File: The repository contains the CSV file, which has hotel bookings data.

# Approach:

1. Understanding the business case.
2. Importing relevant Python libraries and dataset.
3. Data inspection and cleaning.
4. Performing Exploratory Data Analysis to identify factors govern hotel bookings.
5. Document insights and conclusions drawn deom data analysis

# Data Analysis:

- Data Analysis of hotel bookings is done in order to answer the business objectives. The analysis is carried our in 3 steps:

# Univariate Analysis:

- In this analysis, we use the data of one variable to analyze the pattern in it.In this project, we have done analysis on:

1. Most preferred meal type by the customers.
2. Bookings percentage of each hotel.
3. Most preferred distribution channel for hotel bookings.
4. Most bookings from customer origin country.

# Bivariate Analysis:

- In this analysis,we use the data of two variables to analyze the relationship between them. In this project,we have done analysis on:

1. To find most preferred length of stay in each hotel.
2. To identify which room type is in most demand and which room type generate the highest adr.
3. Study the relation between Waiting time and Booking cancellation

# Correlation Analysis:
In this analysis, we have performed correlation heatmap to understand correlation on variables. Correlation analysis computes the level of change in one variable due  to the change in the other. In this dataset, we have performed correlation analysis using a correlation heatmap with the variables, 'lead_time', 'adr', 'total_guests', 'total_stays_in_nights', 'previous_cancellations', 'booking_changes', 'days_in_waiting_list', 'required_car_parking_spaces', 'total_of_special_requests' and 'previous_bookings_not_canceled

# Solution to Business Objective

Roomtype A is the most demanded rooms by the customer while booking, whereas room types H,G,C are generating more adr respectively Hotel management sholud try to increase room types A, to ensure no customer is missed because of unavialability of specific type of rooms. as room type H generating more revenue can give some addon facility to for H type room in order atracts more customer for this specific room type.

vi.  We saw more number of bookings are done by using distrubution chanel TA/TO where Hotel has to share its revenue in terms of comisssion The hotel management can offer discounts, complimentary services and offers on direct bookings as the hotel doesnâ€™t pay commissions to third parties and maintains a direct relationship with the customer when a customer books the hotel directly.
