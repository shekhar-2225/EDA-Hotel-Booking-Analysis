        "Hotel Bookings Analysis project consists with the real - world data record of hotel bookings of a city hotel and a resort hotel for the period 2015 - 2017 respectively. The project data record consists of information such as type of hotel booked, average daily rate, booking details, arrival date, length of the stay, the number of adults, children, and / or babies booked, customer country, meal preferences, type of the customer, parking space details, reservation status, channels used for booking, booking cancellation details, booking lead time details, among other details. Data analysis and data visualization will be performed using Python libraries.\n",

        "I started the Hotel Bookings Analysis project to analyse the data and explore the key factors that govern the hotel bookings. In this project, I have downloaded the given dataset of hotel bookings (CSV file) to use it as a pandas dataframe using pandas library. I have came to know more details about the datset by using df.info() method. I have checked the number of data types in the dataset using value_counts() method. If any column of the dataset has highest missing values, the respective coulmn should be removed using drop() method. I have performed data wrangling using value_counts() method and sort_values method to sort the data accordingly. Fianlly, the Vizualization is done in a structured way while following the \"UBM\" U - Univariate Analysis, B - Bivariate Analysis (Numerical - Categorical, Numerical - Numerical, Categorical - Categorical)"
